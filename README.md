Skylar Kooyenga's Python problems learned from the book: Black Hat Python 2nd edition by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold. This book provides multiple examples of different scripts hackers might use when attacking.
This repository is a collection of all of the python problems I have created from this book. Each problem is inteneded to be run on python 2 or 3. Programs are created and ran in a Kali Linux virtual machine with it's own virtual enironment.
